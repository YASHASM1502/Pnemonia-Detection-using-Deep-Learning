# Pnemonia Detection using Deep Learning.

🩺 Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning
📘 Overview

This project aims to detect Pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Deep Learning techniques. The system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically learn and classify X-ray images as either Normal or Pneumonia.

Early detection of Pneumonia can significantly improve treatment outcomes, and this project demonstrates how AI can assist radiologists by providing accurate and fast predictions.
